Saurcon_RC is code for an ESP32 processor that is built around micro-ros to accept inputs from a ros network and control a Servo and ESC driven BLDC motor. In turn it will publish up data from the servo position as well as the BLDC motor velocity and direction based on the 6 pole hall sensors on the BLDC motor. It will also publish MPU6050 data for the controlling computer to use.
